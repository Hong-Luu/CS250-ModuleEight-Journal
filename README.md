Understanding the wants and preferences of the end users, as well as planning and constructing a program that satisfies those goals, 
allowed me to interpret user needs and implement them into a program.
Creating "user stories" is a method used to help capture the needs of users in a structured and organized way. User stories are short, 
straightforward explanations of a feature or function that a user desires in a software application.
They are used to help developers understand what the user wants, and to make sure that the product meets those needs.

Understanding the problem at hand, recognizing the requirements and constraints, 
and then designing and implementing a solution that meets those needs are how I approach program development.
Agile processes are a set of development methodologies that focus on iterative development, 
continuous feedback, and flexible adaptation.
Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming are a few well-known agile methodologies (XP).
Incorporating agile procedures into future development work can help ensure that the software is produced in an iterative and flexible style, 
with an emphasis on providing value to the end-users.

In software development, being a good team member means collaborating effectively with others, 
communicating clearly and openly, and having a willingness to learn and improve. 
It also means being respectful of other team members and their opinions, 
and working together to achieve the common goal of producing a high-quality product. 
Good team members should also be open to receiving constructive feedback from their teammates and be willing to take on tasks that may not be their primary job.
